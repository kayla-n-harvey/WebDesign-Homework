            <h1>Chapter 1 Summary</h1>
            <span> <p> &quot;Scout explains that when her brother, Jem, was 13, he broke his arm.<br>
                Many years later, they argue about when everything that led to the accident truly began.<br>
                Jem maintains that it began the year Dill arrived, while Scout insists that they take a broader view.<br>
                She gives a brief account of her family's historyâ€”her ancestor Simon Finch who left England to escape religious persecution and established a modest plantation called Finch's Landing. <br>
                The Finches remained on that land until Scout's father, Atticus, and his brother left to study law and medicine, respectively.<br>
                    Atticus set up shop in Maycomb, 20 miles away from Finch's Landing, and is related to nearly everyone in the county. <br>
                    When the story begins, Maycomb is a tired and poor old town, and Scout's family lives on the main residential street. &quot;</p> </span>
