            When Toyota and Lexus decided to create a two-door, short-body LS, 
            they understood they needed to start from scratch. They achieved this by 
             using scanned and digitally stretched-out plastic molds in organic shapes
              using imaging software. Coupe-like shapes were created using this strategy. 
              As a result, the SC models’ two-door coupes were designed to meet what the 
              North American consumer market wanted at the time.
          </p>
        <p> Following the introduction of Lexus in 1989, Toyota’s luxury brand 
            introduced the Lexus SC300 and SC400 sports coupes for the 1992 model year.
             The two doors were sleek and sophisticated, and they made an impression. 
             Lexus SC was on the 10 Best lists from 1992 to 1995. For decades, 
             first-generation SCs, which were produced until the year 2000, has remained 
             largely unnoticed.

                However, given the growing interest in 1990s cars, particularly Japanese cars. 
             These Lexus coupes should see a significant increase in value. Lexus released 
             the SC300 in 1992, during the rise of premium coupes. The Lexus SC 300 was developed 
             with its twin, the Toyota Soarer, for the local Japanese market, with exterior design by Calty Design Research.
             The SC300 and the Supra similarities were quickly noticed, and people began customizing them for high-performance driving. The Lexus SC 300’s performance was a closely guarded secret. As it was utilized as an experimental setup for the then-upcoming Mk4 Supra.
