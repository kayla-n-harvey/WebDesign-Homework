         <P>
            If you are going to go compete in motorsports, why can’t you do it in style? 
            The world of amateur drifting is dominated by an army of buffoons sliding around 
            in beaten Nissan S-chassis cars, held together with nothing but zip ties and a prayer. 
            But why put yourself through that madness when there are perfectly good, perfectly stylish,
             and perfectly capable alternatives like the Lexus SC300?
             </P>
            <p>
            At a local East10 Drift event near Knoxville, Tennessee, a driver by the name of Chris Miller 
            showed up with a sexy green SC300 to take sliding around for the day. With a 1JZ swap sitting 
            under the hood, Miller has plenty of power to kick it sideways and destroy any set of tires that
             could come his way.
             </p>
            <p>
            I dare you not to smile while looking at the photos of the deep-green paint glistening in the sun as
             Chris tries to keep the ass-end from catching the front. It’s a thing of beauty, and it shows the other 
             guys in the sport that you can still be classy while having a good time.
