    <h1>Lexus SC300 Mods</h1>

        <p> However, the ‘Poor Man’s Supra’ can be transformed 
            into a racer or drifter with a few tires, suspension, 
            and brake changes. If you really want to go all out, 
            you can always add a turbo to the Lexus SC300 or swap 
            in the Supra’s engine.
            </p>
            <p>

                If an engine change isn’t an option, you’re probably
                wondering what the naturally aspirated SC300 2JZ-GTE 
                engine can do. We’re happy to let you know that you 
                might be in for a pleasant surprise. Thankfully, it’s 
                not just the 2JZ-GTE that’s a fantastic engine for 
                uncovering the latent potential power that lurks within, 
                and the 2JZ-GE is significantly more capable than many people 
                believe.The rods and crankshaft of the naturally aspirated 2JZ-GE 
                are identical to those in the 2JZ-GTE. Although the pistons differ 
                between the two, they can handle acceptable power figures.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can reliably achieve 400 WHP from your 2JZ-GE with a few easy mods
                like head studs, fuelling upgrades, and an NA-T turbo kit. Isn’t that
                pretty? If you want to increase over 400-450 WHP while still keeping 
                reliability, you’ll need to invest in additional improvements like a 
                more robust head gasket. We’ve seen some 2JZ-GE owners hit 800 WHP with 
                the factory rods and pistons for several years, but we’d personally upgrade
                them as a precaution.Nonetheless, it demonstrates what an outstanding naturally 
                aspirated engine can achieve in the right hands. The SC300 is an ideal prospective
                    drifting platform because of its ease of upgrading and the fantastic handling platform 
                    it shares with the Supra. However, there is one major thing to consider.
                </p>
                <p>
                Because the SC300 was initially developed for the luxury automobile market, most 
                owners didn’t have drifting on their minds when they drove them out of the showroom 
                in the 1990s.
