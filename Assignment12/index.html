        Humans impact the physical environment in many ways: overpopulation, pollution,
         burning fossil fuels, and deforestation. Changes like these have triggered climate change, 
         soil erosion, poor air quality, and undrinkable water. These negative impacts can affect human 
         behavior and can prompt mass migrations or battles over clean water.

            <h3>Pick up litter in your community.</h3>
            <hr>
            You can do this as an individual or join a community group. Many local environmental groups organize bigger events where you 
            can join a team and clear roadways, highways, and neighborhood streets of litter, so see if your local community is hosting anything.

            <h3>Walk or ride your bike</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Going car-free for the day will reduce harmful carbon emissions. Even one day can make a 
                difference, but if you can commit to walking or biking more often in the future, that’s even better! If your daily
                 commute is too far for walking/biking, try these environmentally-conscious alternatives:
              <ul>
                 <li> Public transportation like buses, trains, or shuttles</li> 
               <li>Carpooling with coworkers, friends, or schoolmates</li> 
            </ul>

            <h3>Limit your water use</h3>

            <p>
                Conserve water on a daily basis by turning off the faucet while you brush your teeth, checking the toilet and pipes
                 in your home for leaks, and taking shorter showers. Other small ways to conserve water include using the dishwasher 
                 sparingly and installing a water-saving showerhead.

            <h3>Turn off lights when you’re not using them.</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Turn off lamps and overhead lights whenever you leave a room or your house. If you’re sitting in a room with the sun shining through a window next to you, consider
                 whether you really need an electric light on.
                Electricity often comes from fossil fuels that contribute to climate change, so using as little electricity as possible is a great way to help the Earth.

            <p>If you’re still receiving paper bills in the mail, sign into your account or call the company and tell them you want to switch to paperless billing. These days,
                 most (if not all) credit card and utility companies provide a paperless billing option for their customers who want to save trees and prevent waste
