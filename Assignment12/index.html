        <p> <b>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</b> is a hypothesized relation between an object's degree of resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to the 
            object. The concept suggests that humanoid objects that imperfectly resemble actual human beings provoke uncanny or strangely familiar feelings 
            of uneasiness and revulsion in observers. "Valley" denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica—a valence that otherwise increases
             with the replica's human likeness. is an online tactical shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released worldwide 
             for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on December 1, 2015; the game was also released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S exactly five years later on December 1, 2020.</p>
        <p>
            The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes
             such as rescuing a hostage, defusing a bomb, and taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign but features a series of short, offline missions called, 
             "situations" that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the "White Masks", 
             a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.

             <span class="map"> In Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege, there are several maps that players can engage with. Across various game modes, there are a total of 20 possible maps, making this a very versitile and fun gameplay.</span>
