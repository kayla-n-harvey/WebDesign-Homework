      <h1> Camping</h1>
      Why is camping good for you? The health benefits of camping are plentiful for both adults and young people. When you’re spending time at home in your usual routine, you may not realize just how much you’re missing away from nature.

     <h2> THE BENEFITS OF CAMPING</h2>
      Camping has a great number of benefits for everyone old and young that you and your family can enjoy while spending time in the great outdoors:
      
      <h2>CAMPING HELPS WITH STRESS REDUCTION</h2>
      Leave the overbooked scheduling at home. When you’re camping, there’s no place to be at a certain time, and there’s nothing interrupting you or competing for your attention. The natural outcome of this type of setting is stress reduction and relaxation like you can’t find anywhere else.
      
      <h2> FRESH AIR HAS NUMEROUS BENEFITS</h2>
      You may not realize how scarce fresh air is in your day to day life. When you go camping, you get the wondrous scents of the outdoors, as well as the smell of dinner cooking over an open fire.
      
      <h2>CAMPING IMPROVES RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
      One of the best and most important aspects of camping is how it helps you build and strengthen relationships. When you go camping with friends or family, you get a chance to talk and visit without distraction, even late into the night.
   
      <h2> GET BETTER SLEEP QUALITY WHEN CAMPING</h2>
When was the last time you slept late without an alarm clock to wake you up? When you’re camping, the only alarm clocks you have are the sun and the chirping of birds. Waking up with nature rather than an alarm clock is an experience everyone should have regularly.

<h2>CAMPING ALLOWS YOU TO UNPLUG</h2>
Camping is a great chance for everyone to unplug and get away from their screens. In the great outdoors, you don’t find computers, tablets or televisions and there’s so much else to do that does not require electronics.
